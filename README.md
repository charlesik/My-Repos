# My-Repos
List of Github repositories from user charlesik. This includes the details of each repository and its information. Data is fetched from the Github API. 
Link to deployed site: https://my-github-repos.web.app
The application displays a side bar containing repositories fetched with an API.
This side bar shows a maximum of five repositories per page and can be toggled by clicking the buttons below it.
Under each repository there is a view details link.
The view details link routes to a page containing information about that particular repository. This was implemented using nested routes.
The details page displays just beside the side bar and the information is toggled based on the repository that was clicked.
Error Boundaries were implemented on this project such that in case of any error the application displays an error page.
Search Engine Optimization was also implemented with the the npm helmet package.
